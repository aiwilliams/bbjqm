      <p>This sample shows that "data-prefetch" will not allow us to obtain all
      Pages while online such that the application could work in an offline
      mode.</p>
      <p>Since we are using AJAX Single Page loading, once we leave a Page it
      is deleted from the DOM and forgotten altogether. This causes the Page to
      be reloaded or prefetched again when it is linked to with
      data-prefetch.</p>
      <p>In fact, when you go from index to level1, and then press you're back
      button, you will see that level1 is prefetched again!</p>
